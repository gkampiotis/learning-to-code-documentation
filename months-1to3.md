tl;dr > If youâ€™re self-learning to code, find a way to learn the basics in a fun way. Then start building stuff you want and learn what is needed to do so. 



This is the documentation of the process of me learning to build stuff on the internet. I had no knowledge of coding so I started from the very basics.
 
I started with Processing, a Java-based framework. Processing is suitable for digital media creations. At first I started learning the basics (variables, functions, etc). I followed the tutorials from https://funprogramming.org/ which is well made and was easy to follow along. First few weeks I was making simple drawings and mini-animations of basic shapes or text.
